# RedPanda
## A IDE for beginners

RedPanda is a Java based integrated development environment that provides a smooth coding experience for beginners.

## Features
- Autocompletion
- Syntax highlighting
- Multi file editing
- Single file research
- Entire project research

## Tech

RedPanda uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [JavaFX] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [RichTextFX] - awesome web-based text editor

And of course RedPanda itself is open source with a [public repository][repoLink]
 on GitLab (for now).

## Installation

RedPanda requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to run.

Clone the repository, Install the dependencies and make sure that you have Java installed.

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:sanassi/ping-front.git
